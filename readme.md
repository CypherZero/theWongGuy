# TheWongGuy.com 
___
## Purpose
This would be a simple "Hi, my name is Brian Wong and you've reach the Wong guy!" site that allows me to dump my thoughts into a bowl, mix it with milk and flush it down with a spoon! The main purpose it to use it and its sub-domains to showcase my current and past projects. 

_This should be a simple site that is focused on design rather than functionality._

## Stack 
We'll try to do something new and use NodeJS, Express, and some fancy CSS to produce a single page for now. 
- NodeJS
- Express
- Bootstrap 
- ScrollRevealJS (Paralax scrolling)
- AngularJS
- MongoDB 

## MileStones 
1. Simple single page with contact information, publish to somewhere. 
2. Use MongoDB to Add and manage blog posts 
3. Implement search for all content of the site. 
4. Setup sub-domain 

## Sprints 
- 1
    + ~~setup project in NodeJS and Express~~ 
    + ~~setup repository~~ 
    + Write the first simple page and display it
    + Write basic contact information/github repo 
    + Use ScrollReveal.js to do... something
    + Use Heroku to publish it. 
- 2
    + Get MongoDB running locally
    + define data structures to store a pose (or do we have to????)
    + Implement CRUD for posts 
    + Modify landing page to display posts.
